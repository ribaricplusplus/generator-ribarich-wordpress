Tutorial about how to use the code scaffolded by this generator: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-S6bYo0kT0

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ribarich-wordpress using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ribarich-wordpress
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo ribarich-wordpress
```

## Notes and troubleshooting

This generator is optimized to work with LocalWP.

When running tests, you need to run the `npm run test-phpunit` from the shell launched by LocalWP, because it will contain all the required PHP extensions.

WordPress wp-phpunit test package does database table manipulation that can sometimes fail because of `sql_mode` configuration. If you get an error when running tests related to database tables, try modifying `sql_mode` in `my.cnf.hbs`:


```
sql_mode = ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
```

## Development

Get started with developing this generator.

- Clone the repository
- npm install
- npm link
- yo ribarich-wordpress => Runs the generator as it is in its current state. Make sure that any global version of the generator from npm is uninstalled.
